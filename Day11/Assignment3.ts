/*
Exhaustiveness Checking (The never Type)
Scenario: You want to ensure that if a new member is added to a Union, your logic must be updated
 to handle it.
Task:
Create a union type TaskStatus = 'Open' | 'InProgress' | 'Closed'.
Write a function handleTask(status: TaskStatus) using a switch statement.
In the default case, assign the status to a variable of type never.
The Test: Add 'Archived' to the union and verify that the code fails to compile until you add the
 new case.
